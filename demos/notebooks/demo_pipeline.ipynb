    "# CNMF demo pipeline: Intro\n",
    "This demo provides a full pipeline for the analysis of a two-photon calcium imaging dataset using the CaImAn software package. It demonstrates how to use Caiman for the following analysis steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Full CNMF Workflow](images/full_cnmf_workflow.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Apply the nonrigid motion correction (NoRMCorre) algorithm for motion correction.\n",
    "2) Apply the constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF) source separation algorithm to extract initial estimates of neuronal spatial footprints and calcium traces.  \n",
    "3) Apply quality control metrics to evaluate the initial estimates, and narrow down to the final set of estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above core analysis steps, the demo also shows how to extract $\\Delta F/F$ for the calcium traces, and  how to use Caiman's multiple visualization tools on your data to inspect the results at each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNMF algorithm is best for data with relatively low background noise, like most two-photon data and *some* one photon data (e.g., certain light sheet data). For a demo analysis pipeline of a one-photon microendoscopic data set see `demo_pipeline_cnmfE.ipynb`."

One, you can just load some of your data into a movie object using the `subindices` argument to the `load()` function.

    "    If you hit memory issues later, there are a few things you can do. First, you may want to lower the number of processors you are using. Each processor uses more RAM, and on a workstation with many processors, you can sometimes get better performance by reducing <em>num_processors_to_use</em>.The best way to determine the optimal number is by trial and error. When you set <em>num_processors_to_use</em> variable to <em>None</em>, it defaults to <i>one</i> less than the total number of CPU cores available (the reason we don't automatically set it to the total number of cores is because in practice this typically leads to worse performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>Second, if your system has less than 32GB of RAM, and things are running slowly or you are running out of memory, then get more RAM. While you can sometimes get away with less, we recommend a *bare minimum* level of 16GB of RAM, but more is better. 32GB RAM is acceptable, 64GB or more is best. Obviously, this will depend on the size of your data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>Third, try subsampling your data. You can *spatially* or *temporally* subsample. If you are already sampling at a low frame rate, you should probably just spatially subsample. You can do this outside of Caiman (many acquisition systems have this capability built in), and load the subsampled file into the notebook directly. This will make subsequent analysis less prone to subtle errors. You can also set Caiman's `ssub` and `tsub` parameters (spatial and temporal subsampling parameters). If you do set `ssub` to 2, then you should divide `gSig` by 2. Dealing with such parameter side-effects is why it is easier to subsample *before* importing data into Caiman. If the results of your analysis with subsampled data look reasonable, then you are good to go. What if you can't subsample your data? \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>If none of the above memory optimization procedures work, you may just have too much data for offline CNMF. For this case, we also provide an online version of CNMF (OnACID), which uses a small number of frames to initialize the spatial and temporal components, and iteratively updates the components as new data comes in. This uses much less memory than the offline approach. The demo notebook for OnACID is found in <a href=\"./demo_OnACID_mesoscope.ipynb\">demo_OnACID_mesoscope.ipynb</a>.
