    "   Background activity is very ill-behaved with 1p recordings: it often fluctuates locally and is much larger in magnitude than the neural signals we want to extract. In other words, the large-scale background model used for CNMF is not sufficient for most 1p data. Hence, Pengcheng Zhou and others came up with a localized model of background activity for CNMFE: the background at each pixel is represented as the weighted sum of activity from a circle (or ring) of pixels a certain distance from that pixel. The distance of this ring from the reference pixel is set by the <em>ring_size_factor</em> parameter. This more complex pixel-by-pixel background model explains why CNMFE is computationally more expensive than CNMF, and also why it works better to mop up large-scale localized background noise in  1p data. \n",

    "<p>When you set <em>gnb</em> in the CNMF model (usually to 1 or 2), you are setting the number of global background components. The fact that you can get away with so few is testament to how well-behaved the background activity is in 2p recordings. When we set <em>gnb</em> to 0 in Caiman, this is a flag telling Caiman's back end to switch to the more complicated ring model of the background activity.</p>\n",

This mean centering creates a Gaussian with a positive peak in the middle of width <i>approximately</i> <em>gSig/2</em>, surrounded by a negative trench, and a ledge of zeros around the outer edges.

The PNR is the ratio of the maximum magnitude at a pixel to the noise value at that pixel (it is a fast and rough measure of signal-to-noise).

The [Mesmerize](https://github.com/nel-lab/mesmerize-core) package is a great way to search parameter space and visualize results with more sophisticated visualization tools if you have a tricky data set."
